# My resources

## Plugins
### [SuperPowers](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/SuperPowers)
My biggest Spigot plugin so far. A very cool plugin which adds a whole new mechanism and mode to your server- adds 7 different combat abilities and powers, and another 7 different bow abilities. This plugin appends a whole new system and theme to your server.
### [ExplodingFood](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/ExplodingFood)
One of the first yet best plugins I have released. Although it's very small, it can add such a cool feature to your server, with almost every feature can be customized to your own will.
### [WaterProof Blazes](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/WaterProofBlazes)
A plugin which was made upon a friend's request, yet I thought it'd be useful to release it. Blazes could now play in the rain and swim on the beaches with this plugin!
### [StaffJQ](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/StaffJQ)
A fulfilled request made upon someone, which sends special messages when a staff joins. Can be a good addition to any server
### [SetHunger](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/SetHunger)
My first plugin ever released on Spigot. Although it's not that useful, it really was when you need to mess with others!
