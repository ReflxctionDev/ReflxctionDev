# Reflxction - About me

Hello! I'm Reflxction. A young developer who was inspired by computer programming and has worked with lots of frameworks. Continue reading to know more about any resource I made :)

# My resources

## Plugins
### [SuperPowers](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/SuperPowers)
My biggest Spigot plugin so far. A very cool plugin which adds a whole new mechanism and mode to your server- adds 7 different combat abilities and powers, and another 7 different bow abilities. This plugin appends a whole new system and theme to your server.
### [ExplodingFood](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/ExplodingFood)
One of the first yet best plugins I have released. Although it's very small, it can add such a cool feature to your server, with almost every feature can be customized to your own will.
### [WaterProof Blazes](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/WaterProofBlazes)
A plugin which was made upon a friend's request, yet I thought it'd be useful to release it. Blazes could now play in the rain and swim on the beaches with this plugin!
### [StaffJQ](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/StaffJQ)
A fulfilled request made upon someone, which sends special messages when a staff joins. Can be a good addition to any server
### [SetHunger](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/SetHunger)
My first plugin ever released on Spigot. Although it's not that useful, it really was when you need to mess with others!
## Minecraft Forge Modifications
### [AutoMSG](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/AutoMSG)
My first ever made Hypixel mod. With it's countless features and great functionality, this mod was the #1 decision for lazy people
### [NameFormatter](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/NameFormatter)
My first "serious" mod to be released. This mod was made in order to support the Guild-vs-Guild team in my Hypixel guild (Impurity), which highlights guild members in order to simplify hunting enemies, although this has really improved my skills in caching and using Gradle
### [Nerd-Alert](https://reflxctiondev.github.io/Nerd-Alert)
Probably one of the funniest mods founded on Earth. What this does is show an alert everytime a nerd joins, funny enough, many people use it :P
